Consider cache invalidation, multi-layer caching, cache warming strategies, and consistency across distributed systems. Provide specific implementation patterns and technologies.\n\n{{#if context}}\n## Context\n\nThe current e-commerce platform experiences performance issues during high traffic events. Product data includes prices, descriptions, images, variants, inventory levels, and customer reviews. The system serves global customers with different regional catalogs and pricing. Cache misses result in database overload and slow page loads.\n{{/if}}\n\n## Instructions\n\nPlease analyze this architecture decision and provide your recommendation. Consider the requirements, constraints, and trade-offs involved.\n\nFocus on:\n- Technical feasibility\n- Scalability implications\n- Development complexity\n- Long-term maintainability\n- Cost considerations\n\nProvide a clear recommendation with supporting rationale.",
