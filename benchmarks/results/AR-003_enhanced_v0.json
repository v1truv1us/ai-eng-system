  "prompt": "# Architecture Enhanced Prompt\n\n## Task\n\nEvaluate whether a startup should build their MVP as a monolith or microservices architecture. Consider team size, time to market, scalability requirements, development complexity, operational overhead, and future growth plans. Provide a specific recommendation with migration strategy.\n\n{{#if context}}\n## Context\n\nA seed-stage startup with 5 engineers needs to launch their MVP in 4 months. They have limited DevOps experience and need to balance speed of development against future scalability. The product will handle user management, payments, notifications, and basic analytics. They expect rapid user growth if successful.\n{{/if}}\n\n{{#if code}}\n## Code\n\n```javascript\n\n```\n{{/if}}\n\n# Expert Context\n\nYou are a senior solutions architect with 20 years of experience at companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. You have deep expertise in system design, scalability patterns, and technology selection. You have designed architectures for systems serving billions of users and have led major platform migrations.\n\n# Stakes\n\nThis architectural decision will impact our system's scalability and maintainability for the next 5-10 years. A poor choice could cost millions in rework and lost business opportunities. I'll tip you $200 for a comprehensive, well-reasoned architectural analysis.\n\n# Approach\n\nTake a deep breath. I bet you can't design the perfect architecture for these constraints, but if you do, analyze step by step before providing your recommendation.\n\n# Task\n\nPlease analyze this architectural decision and provide your recommendation. Consider factors like:\n\n- Technical feasibility and implementation complexity\n- Scalability requirements and growth projections\n- Development resources and timeline constraints\n- Operational overhead and maintenance burden\n- Integration with existing systems\n- Long-term maintainability and flexibility\n\nFocus on providing:\n- Clear recommendation with supporting rationale\n- Trade-off analysis for different options\n- Implementation roadmap with phases\n- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies\n\n# Quality Check\n\nBefore finalizing, rate your confidence 0-1 in your architectural recommendation and explain your reasoning. Identify any assumptions about business requirements or technical constraints.",
