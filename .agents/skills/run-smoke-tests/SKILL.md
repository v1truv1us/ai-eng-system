## Pi Context-Aware Execution

When this skill is invoked in Pi, treat the user's current request and any skill arguments as the task input. Do not treat this file as the task by itself.

Before applying the skill, establish only the context needed for the request:

1. Identify the current working directory and relevant project scope.
2. Read local guidance first when present: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, or nearby task/spec files.
3. Inspect the current codebase with targeted searches (prefer rg) and read relevant files before making claims or proposing changes.
4. Ground findings and recommendations in project evidence: cite file paths, commands, tests, docs, or external sources as applicable.
5. Ask a concise clarification only when the arguments and codebase context are insufficient to proceed safely.

Operate conservatively: avoid broad scans, large reads, subagents, or parallel fanout unless the user's requested depth clearly requires them.
# Run smoke tests

## Trigger

Need end-to-end smoke verification before or after changes.

## Workflow

1. Build prerequisites for the target app.
2. Run the relevant smoke suite or a focused test file.
3. If failing, inspect traces/logs and isolate the root cause.
4. Apply a minimal fix and rerun until stable.

## Example Commands

```bash
# Run full smoke suite
npm run smoketest

# Run a specific smoke test file
npm run smoketest -- path/to/test.spec.ts

# Faster iteration when build artifacts are ready
npm run smoketest-no-compile -- path/to/test.spec.ts
```

## Guardrails

- Prefer deterministic waits and assertions over brittle timeouts.
- Re-run passing fixes to reduce flaky false positives.
- Quarantine tests only when explicitly requested and documented.

## Output

- Test results summary
- Root cause and fix
- Remaining flake risk (if any)
