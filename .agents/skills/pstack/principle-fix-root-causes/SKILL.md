## Pi Context-Aware Execution

When this skill is invoked in Pi, treat the user's current request and any skill arguments as the task input. Do not treat this file as the task by itself.

Before applying the skill, establish only the context needed for the request:

1. Identify the current working directory and relevant project scope.
2. Read local guidance first when present: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, or nearby task/spec files.
3. Inspect the current codebase with targeted searches (prefer rg) and read relevant files before making claims or proposing changes.
4. Ground findings and recommendations in project evidence: cite file paths, commands, tests, docs, or external sources as applicable.
5. Ask a concise clarification only when the arguments and codebase context are insufficient to proceed safely.

Operate conservatively: avoid broad scans, large reads, subagents, or parallel fanout unless the user's requested depth clearly requires them.
# Fix Root Causes

When debugging, do not paper over symptoms. Trace every problem to its root cause and fix it there.

**Why:** Symptom fixes accumulate. Each workaround makes the system harder to reason about, and the real bug remains. Root-cause fixes are slower upfront but reduce total debugging time.

**Pattern:**
- Reproduce first (if you can't reproduce it, you can't verify your fix)
- Ask "why" until you hit the root cause
- Resist the urge to add guards (adding a nil check to silence a crash is a symptom fix)
- Check for the pattern, not just the instance (grep for the same pattern, fix all instances)
- When stuck, instrument. Don't guess (add logging, read the actual error)

**Restart bugs: suspect state before code**

Code doesn't change between runs. State does. When something "fails after restart," suspect stale persistent state first: config files, caches, lock files, serialized state. If clearing a state file restores behavior, prioritize state validation as the fix.
