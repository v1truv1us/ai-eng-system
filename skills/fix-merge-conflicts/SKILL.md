## Pi Context-Aware Execution

When this skill is invoked in Pi, treat the user's current request and any skill arguments as the task input. Do not treat this file as the task by itself.

Before applying the skill, establish only the context needed for the request:

1. Identify the current working directory and relevant project scope.
2. Read local guidance first when present: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, or nearby task/spec files.
3. Inspect the current codebase with targeted searches (prefer rg) and read relevant files before making claims or proposing changes.
4. Ground findings and recommendations in project evidence: cite file paths, commands, tests, docs, or external sources as applicable.
5. Ask a concise clarification only when the arguments and codebase context are insufficient to proceed safely.

Operate conservatively: avoid broad scans, large reads, subagents, or parallel fanout unless the user's requested depth clearly requires them.
# Fix merge conflicts

## Trigger

Branch has unresolved merge conflicts and needs a reliable path to a buildable state.

## Workflow

1. Detect all conflicting files from git status and conflict markers.
2. Resolve each conflict with minimal, correctness-first edits.
3. Prefer preserving both sides when safe. Otherwise, choose the variant that compiles and keeps public behavior stable.
4. Regenerate lockfiles with package manager tools instead of hand-editing.
5. Run compile, lint, and relevant tests.
6. Stage resolved files and summarize key decisions.

## Guardrails

- Keep changes minimal and readable.
- Do not leave conflict markers in any file.
- Avoid broad refactors while resolving conflicts.
- Do not push or tag during conflict resolution.

## Output

- Files resolved
- Notable resolution choices
- Build/test outcome
